JStarter
========
A simple PStart-like program made in Java to be compatible to every OS
========

Basically, It allows you to have a nice menu for all your apps on UsbKey (Portable applications). It was made since PStart is Windows only, and others are too complex. I just needed a simple menu with my apps ;)
/!\ Even if I made everything in my possible for it to be multi-os, it will not work on a single key for Anywhere to this shit called Windows. 
The problem is that it does not recognise Ext4 or any unix-permission-file so the programs wont be able to load since you cant chmod +x a file on FAT32/NTFS partition.
Sorry for the inconvenience :(

=========
Compiling
=========

Grab the jdom 2.0.5 lib (For the config save) and add it to your eclipse build path. You are then ready to build it.
