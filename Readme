JStarter

========


A simple PStart-like program made in Java to be compatible to every OS
========

Basically, It allows you to have a nice menu for all your apps on UsbKey (Portable applications). It was made since PStart is Windows only, and others are too complex. I just needed a simple menu with my apps ;)

=========
Compiling
=========

Grab the jdom 2.0.5 lib (For the config save) and add it to your eclipse build path. You are then ready to build it.
